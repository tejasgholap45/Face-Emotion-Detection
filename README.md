# 😊 Face Emotion Detection Web App

A professional **Face Emotion Detection** web application built using **TensorFlow (CNN)** and **Streamlit**, capable of detecting human emotions from facial expressions in images.

🔗 **Live Demo:**  
https://face-emotion-detection-the-tejasbhau.streamlit.app/

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project uses a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on facial expression data to classify emotions such as:

- Angry  
- Disgust  
- Fear  
- Happy  
- Neutral  
- Sad  
- Surprise  

The application allows users to upload an image, detects faces using OpenCV’s Haar Cascade classifier, and predicts the emotion with confidence scores.

## 🚀 Features

- 📤 Image upload-based emotion detection  
- 🧠 Deep Learning model using TensorFlow & Keras  
- 🙂 Automatic face detection using Haar Cascade  
- 📊 Emotion confidence score display  
- 🎨 Clean & professional Streamlit UI  
- ☁️ Cloud-deployed and publicly accessible  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Framework:** Streamlit  
- **Deep Learning:** TensorFlow / Keras  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV (Haar Cascade)  
- **Model Hosting:** Google Drive (auto-download)

## 🧪 How It Works

1. User uploads a face image  
2. Face is detected using Haar Cascade  
3. Image is preprocessed (grayscale, resize, normalization)  
4. CNN model predicts emotion  
5. Emotion label and confidence score are displayed
